Guide to the Projectile Motion Plotter by Ababs Moosajee

Question 1 of Portfolio 1 is answered in P1_Q1fun.m which uses the Euler's model,
to plot projectile motion. The Euler's model is saved in a seperate function file called
Eulersfunction.m.

Question 2 of Portfolio is answered in P1_Q2fun.m, where both function files 
EulersFunction.m and RungeKutta.m are called upon to compare and evaluate the two methods.

Question 3a is answered in the file P1_Q3a.m, where the bouncing particle is simulated

Question 3b is answered in P1_Q3bfun.m where drag on multiple particles is simulated
through various fluids, by calling upon the function file ProjectileDrag.m

Lastly, a combined script is created called RealisticProjectileMotion.m, which combines 
drag, impact and simple projectile motion into one single script allowing 
user to select various variables like Fluids, Particles, Gravity and even combos such as
Bouncing Ball with Drag.
